OMERO Microservice Backbone
===========================

OMERO Vert.x asynchronous microservice service infrastructure for integration
with an OMERO server instance.  The "backbone" services host a layer that
provides endpoints, accessible over the Vert.x eventbus, that expose various
OMERO server functionality. 

This infrastructure relies on the OMERO server extension mechanism::

* https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.4.10/developers/Server/ExtendingOmero.html

Requirements
============

* OMERO 5.4.x+
* Java 8+

Workflow
========

The microservice service infrastructure relies on the following workflow::

1. Placement of all JARs from `lib` folder of the distribution into the
`lib/server` folder of your OMERO instance

1. Configuring `omero.ms.backbone.cluster_host` OMERO server configuration
property if required

1. Configuration of Hazelcast via the `hazelcast.xml.example` enclosed in the
distribution and placement in the `etc` folder of your OMERO instance

1. Symlinking of the `omero-ms-backbone*.jar` to `extensions.jar` in order to
activate the infrastructure

1. (Optional) Configuring `omero.ms.backbone.event_listeners` OMERO server
configuration property with one or more of "INSERT", "UPDATE", and "DELETE" to
enable the respective event listeners to propagate Hibernate events from OMERO
to Hazelcast

1. Restarting your OMERO server

Configuring Logging
===================

Logging is provided using the logback library and piggybacks on the OMERO server
configuration.  You can configure logging by editing the `etc/logback.xml` of
your OMERO instance and adding loggers for `com.glencoesoftware.omero.ms` and/or
`com.hazelcast`::

    ...
    <logger name="com.glencoesoftware.omero.ms" level="DEBUG"/>
    <logger name="com.hazelcast" level="DEBUG"/>
    ...

Development Installation
========================

1. Clone the repository::

        git clone git@github.com:glencoesoftware/omero-ms-backbone.git

1. Run the Gradle build and utilize the artifacts as required::

        ./gradlew installDist
        cd build/install
        ...

1. Log in to the OMERO instance you would like to develop against with and 
extract a session key.. This can be done using the `login` and `sessions`
command line plugins for example::

        $ bin/omero login
        Previous session expired for root on localhost:4064
        Server: [localhost:4064]
        Username: [root]
        Password:
        Created session for root@localhost:4064. Idle timeout: 10 min. Current group: system
        $ bin/omero sessions list
         Server         | User | Group  | Session                              | Active    | Started
        ----------------+------+--------+--------------------------------------+-----------+--------------------------
         localhost:4064 | root | system | 97db5b88-5d7e-40f8-883b-17cf549f6126 | Logged in | Fri Feb  1 13:58:38 2019
        (1 row)

1. Run single or multiple image region tests using `curl`::

        curl http://localhost:9090/api/<session_key>/...

Eclipse Configuration
=====================

Used for testing the various endpoints.

1. Run the Gradle Eclipse task::

        ./gradlew eclipse

1. Add a new Run Configuration with a main class of `io.vertx.core.Starter`::

        run "com.glencoesoftware.omero.ms.backbone.QueryVerticle" -cluster -cluster-host <cluster_host>

Running Tests
=============

Using Gradle run the unit tests:

    ./gradlew test
